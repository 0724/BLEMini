BLEMini
=======

BLE Mini is a small, certified BLE development board for makers to do their innovative projects. Here are some samples to show how to integrate this board to other platform such as Arduino.

Samples show how to connect iOS/Mac to your Arduino via BLE link. More interesting resource will be added soon.

SimpleControls
- This demo shows how to create controls for common Arduino pin settings
- Please refer to "Readme_SimpleControls.txt" for details

Chat
- A simple chat demo for iOS to talk to Arduino
- Please refer to "Readme_Chat.txt" for details

Requirement
===========

This requires BLE Framework to compile for iOS or Mac samples. 

If you are not sure how to do, we highly suggest to downlaod a full stable package so that you can try BLE Mini as fast as possible.
